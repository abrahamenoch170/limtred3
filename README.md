Limetred — Operation Sage II Submission 🍋

​The First "Venture-as-a-Service" Protocol

​AI → Code → Launch → Liquidity → Gamify

​Limtred is a dual-sided protocol:

​For Builders: An AI engine that turns prompts into fully deployed Web3 businesses.

​For Users: A "Direct Access" arcade where anyone can connect a wallet (or create one instantly) to bet, battle, and trade on the modules deployed by the protocol.

​Current Status & Scope

​Frontend: ✅ Completed Prototype 
Live at https://limtred3.vercel.app

​Built with: Next.js 14, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Glint Design System.

​Features: Vibe Terminal, Loot Box Generation Theater, Dashboard UI.

​Backend & Contracts: 🚧 In Progress (Architectural Roadmap defined below).

​Goal: To be built iteratively during the Operation Sage II build phase.

​💡 The Core Vision

​Current AI tools (Replit, Cursor) are for Developers. They output code.

Limtred is for Founders & Degens. It outputs Liquidity & Action.

​We are building a "Vibe-Coding Engine" where the AI acts as the CTO, CFO, and Lead Engineer simultaneously.
​Builder: "Build a prediction market for Anime battles."

​Limtred: Deploys the App + Token + Market.

​User: Connects wallet to Limetred directly to bet on those battles without needing to find the builder's URL.

​⚙️ Core Features & Modules

​1. The AI Code Generation Engine
​The brain of the operation. It doesn't just write text; it outputs production-ready file structures.

​Frontend Gen: Next.js, React, Tailwind, ShadCN.

​Backend Gen: Node.js/Express services, PostgreSQL schema.

​Contract Gen: Modular Smart Contracts (DEX, Staking, Launchpad) for EVM & Base.

​Capabilities: Environment variable injection (.env), Dependency resolution, and Auto-Repair loops.

​2. The Wallet & Identity System (Dual Mode) 

​A seamless, non-custodial solution for both Builders and Consumers.

​For Builders: Encrypted key management to deploy contracts.

​For Consumers (Direct Access):

​Instant Burner Wallets: Users can click "Play Now" and get a browser-based session wallet generated instantly (no extension needed).

​Connect Wallet: Supports MetaMask, Phantom, and WalletConnect for power users.

​Social Login: "Login with X" allows users to trade/bet without handling seed phrases immediately.

​3. The DEX + Launchpad System

​We solve the "Cold Start" liquidity problem. We don't ask users to find a DEX; we are the DEX.

​Smart Contracts:

​Swap.sol: Automated Market Maker (AMM) logic.

​Liquidity.sol: Pool management and LP token minting.

​Launchpad.sol: Presale logic with vesting and caps.

​The Bonding Curve: Instant liquidity pricing (P = S^2) that transitions to a public DEX (Uniswap/Raydium) upon hitting market cap targets.

​4. The "Direct Access" Module Suite (Consumer Arcade) 

​These modules are not just code templates. They are live, interactive dApps hosted on Limetred. 

Users can access them directly via the "Explore" tab.

​A. Prediction Market Engine ("The Oracle")

​Direct Access: Users browse a feed of active markets (e.g., "Will BTC hit $100k?") and bet instantly.
​Revenue: 1% of every bet goes to Limetred.

​B. PvP & Tournament Engine ("The Arena")
​Direct Access: Users enter "Lobbies" to battle 1v1 for tokens.

​Mechanic: "Deposit 10 SOL. Winner takes 19 SOL. Protocol takes 1 SOL."

​Revenue: High-velocity rake on every match.

​C. Synthetic & Derivative Engine ("The Mirror")
​Direct Access: Users mint "Pegged Assets" (e.g., $GOLD, $TSLA) using their meme tokens as collateral.
​Revenue: Mint/Burn fees.

​D. Gamification Layer ("The Sticky Module")
​Direct Access: Global Leaderboard. "Top Traders this Week."

​Rewards: Users earn "XP" for every interaction, unlocking lower fees and "Sniper" privileges.
